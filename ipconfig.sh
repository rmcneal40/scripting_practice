# Part 2: Creating the Script
# In your SSH session, use the touch command to create helloworld.sh in your git-initialized directory.

# Access helloworld.sh with Nano using nano helloworld.sh.

# Have your script fetch network adapter information and save it to a variable.

# Create a new file, output.txt, in the same directory.

# Print the network adapter information from the variable to output.txt.

# For all automation challenge scripts in this class, add the below information as comments:

# Script Name
# Author
# Date of last revision
# Description of purpose
# Declaration of variables
# Declaration of functions (if used)
# Main
# End

#!/bin/bash

#need to declare a variable and a sign of value
# 
ipconfig /all > output.txt

#need to figure out how to print out the network information


#I need to create a textfile and put the networking info inside of it
