# Create a bash script that launches a menu system with the following options:
# Hello world (prints “Hello world!” to the screen)
# Ping self (pings this computer’s loopback address)
# IP info (print the network adapter information for this computer)
# Exit
# Next, the user input should be requested.
# The program should next use a conditional statement to evaluate the user’s input, then act according to what the user selected.
# Use a loop to bring up the menu again after the request has been executed.

#!/bin/bash


echo "Hello world"

function menu() {
