Write a README.md that explains your repo. Answer the following in your README.md:

What is repository all about?
A repository is the configuration data for PowerShell Universal is primarily stored within the repository. By default, the repository folder can be found in my github.com profile. GitHub repository is defined as a location in the GitHub platform where the files and codes corresponding to the projects and their respective versions as a part of revision history is stored, managed, and used. One can discuss and manage the entire projectâ€™s work inside the repository itself. The repository acts as a platform where one can perform collaborative work amongst the team members and even across cross-functional teams. Repository is also seen to be used for collection of user feedback, software bug reporting, tasks organization. Another interesting feature that is used by GitHub repository is asked and answer questions within the repository and even make announcements about the project. 
The repository contains PowerShell scripts and XML files that are produced when using the PowerShell Universal admin console. The repository folder is also watched for changes so any change made on disk will cause the system to reload the file and reconfigure the platform. When using Git integration, the repository folder is what is synchronized with the git remote. 
All configuration cmdlets are part of the Universal module.

Why are you learning these skills?  GitHub provides a very clear and easy way for the documentation of your project. Since documentation is necessary to transfer the idea and provide a base of your project, It provides a very easy way to do so. A ReadMe file with predefined syntax will contain the documentation to understand the concept of the project.
Is this only for developers?
GitHub is not only important for development but also for recruitment. GitHub gives you credit for the contributions you provide on the different projects worldwide. This is mentioned in your profile. So, if you are a recruiter or someone looking for a job, GitHub provides an excellent platform for you. If your reputation is good, you surely know what you have been doing and hence recruiters take you easily.
GitHub Repository and Integrations
GitHub is a platform used for hosting the repositories on which we work through Git. A GitHub repository will contain different tabs to navigate through such as Issues, Insights, Settings etc. To give you a clear look, see the below image.

What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201? I learned about building up foundational Windows troubleshooting skills by exploring and overcoming challenging scenario-based labs. Key skills such as communication, knowledge and process documentation, fundamental terminal operations, performance monitoring, system process management, issue handling, backup/imaging/recovery tools, and software application operations are developed.
The course focuses on practical systems support and troubleshooting. Students will utilize the CompTIA troubleshooting methodology as well as the ITIL service management framework to communicate, resolve, and document issues and incidents. Students will also study how endpoints interact with the greater IT infrastructure, exploring concepts such as network ports and protocols, Wi-Fi, and server-based user identity support.

What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why? My favorite ops chalenges was building my own if and else statements, with scripting practice. I really enjoyed the ops challenges because it gave me a better outlook on how writing code works. The more code I learned the more I wanted to learn, which shows a high level of entrace to myself.

How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?  A computer programer can run in the UNIX shell command line interpreter for file manipulation, program execution and printing text is called Shell Scripting. Mostly system administration tasks are performed using Shell scripting such as disk backups, evaluating system logs and also used as installation scripts for complex programming

What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time? working with ==: Equals
>=: Greater than or equal to
<=: Lesser than or equal to
>: Greater than
<: Lesser than
!=: Not equal

What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next? Writing good Shell scripts! It is a skill, writing better performance shell scripts is an art.  Shell scripts are any Unix admin's asset. It is a major time saver for repetitive activities in Unix flavors. When a shell script is written, by default, the big target in-front of the developer is to make the script running, and of course, to give the right result. As long as these scripts are intended for some user account activities which does not involve huge data, it does not matter how the result is arrived at. However, the same cannot be said on those Shell scripts which are meant to be executed on production servers containing millions of customer records present in huge files. Shell script can give the right result, but if the result does not arrive in a considerable time, it is an issue, and yes, it can become a nightmare for the support staff. Every second is important in a production environment. A script which can be improved by even some 10 seconds can be considered an improvement depending on the environment. In this article, we will discuss about some import things which a shell script developer should keep in mind while writing shell scripts to give better performance.
Better file handling: Knowingly or unknowingly, a lot of files are created or deleted in a shell script. Due to the use of large number of files, handling of files become very important. Even a simple echo statement which re-directs output to a file has to open the file first, write data into the file and close the file
Publish it.
